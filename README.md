This project consists scripts and instructions for working with **Seisomp software**. **Seiscomp** - it is big application, which allow **obtain**, **charge** and **process** seismology data. Seiscomp developers is a GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. In this paper I try to explain how you can charge your seismology data in Seiscomp. In our case Seiscomp consists three types of data: seismic traces (**MSEED**), metadata about seismology stations (**StationXML**) and informaton about seismic events (**QuakeML/SeiscompML**). You can find more information about this formats in **obspy** documentation.
